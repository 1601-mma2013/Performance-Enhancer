Project Name – UI Controller 

*I. Analysis*

 

1. Research

**a. Scope**

1. objectives

To let the user get the best performance of the pc they are using

**b. Audit**

1.     Business and marketing plans

Unlock the full potential of the pc. Most hardware are softlocked to perform an action only with limited hardware, this will let the processes run faster using full hardware available

2.     branding strategy

optimiser- the ability to change the performance status 

3.     market/field research 

Rainmeter , unpark

4.     product portfolio plans 

calculate the frame rate displayed  

5.     competitors 

Steam Game Overlay, Overwolf 

6.     relevant technologies 

Xbox, Playstation etc.

**c. Stakeholder Interviews**

1.     product{project} vision 

To be able to unlock the full potential of the pc. 

2.     Risk

Not knowing the full capabilities of the machine the user is using.  

3.     constraints 

The user might not be satisfied with their desired UI. 

4.     opportunities 

1. In spite of the obstacles we have, this project has strength from 

a) Lightweight software

b) Free to use

c) Completely customisable  

5.     users 

the users are between 18-28 .  

**d. User Interviews & observations**

Understand user needs and behavior and describe it. Find various aspect of audience/customer

1.     Users

Aged between 18 -28

2.     potential users

multimedia students, and overclockers 

3.     behaviors

Wants the best of the hardware they paid so much for

4.     attitudes

gets frustrated when the quality of the performance of the hardware is not up to the mark  

5.     aptitudes

users can use this application to set a benchmark for their device to perform and just let it  run in the background

6.     motivations

users don’t have to worry about having to lose out on the performance of their device they paid for 

7.     environments

iMacs for example are soft locked to access hard wares but it has it internally so this app  lets you utilise the full capabilityof the hard ware  

8.     tools

Processing, Github

9.     challenges

To make the program run smoothly with no delay in processing.

**1.Workflows among multiple people**

Must have a team to create a project and carry out the work with a specific part; Designer, Communication Designer and manager. The designer is the one who brainstorms and comes out with the strongest idea, the design communicator is the one who has to find an idea on how to create connection in the project and the manager has to manage the progress of the project and make sure it is up to date.

*II. Synthesis*

*3. Requirements Definition*

**a. Context Scenarios**

Adam is a student at Multimedia University. He uses his computer to study and to complete his various assignments. To complete his various assignments, he needs to use some high-end software that requires him to use his computer to its maximum potential. This high-end software uses up a lot of memory and requires a high performance pc in order for it to be stable. Adam boots up the application to check on the performance of his computer. He sees a few applications running in the background and closes it. Adam then adjusts some settings on the application and his computer immediately performs faster than before. Adam is then able to open up the software to do his assignments. 

**b. Requirements**

1.	Functional and data needs – The pc’s hardware specification and its full run potential compared to the current run potential  
	
2.	user mental models – between the ages of 15 and 18
	
3.	design imperatives – translucent overlay over the user’s desktop

4.	product vision - To be able to unlock the full potential of the pc
	
5.	business requirements – adverts online

6.	technology – processing, github

*4. Design Framework*

**a. Elements**

1.	Deﬁne manifestations of information and functionality 1. Information 2. form factor 3. posture 4. input method 


*1.  functional and data elements*

•	Information - so that the user know how his computer is performing 

•	functions – to display the current performance of the pc 

•	mechanisms – the hardware’s performance ratio used

•	actions – the program overwrites default config files in the system to let the user have the full capability of the hardware 

•	domain object models – service app 

**b. Framework**

Design overall structure of user experience 

*1. Sketch*

**i.	if your project is a design product**

a.	Your sketch must be a wireframe.

**ii.	if your project is a installation project**

a.	Your sketch must be a installation sketch.

**iii.	Must have**

a.	groupings and hierarchy

b.	Territories of each functional & design elements

c.	Arrangements of containers & components



*2.	Key path Scenario*

The user downloads the freeware on their pc. Once they install it, they will have to restart it cause the original config files have to be overwritten. Once rebooted, they will have few new UI’s on their desktop. By using these interfaces, the user can set the range of performance they want to achieve. Once the optimal settings are set, the software will unlock the hard drive and give the user the desired performance range.
