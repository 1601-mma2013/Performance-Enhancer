						Project Name- Performance Enhancer

*I. Analysis*

 1. 	Research

**a. Scope**

 1.     Objectives

To let the user get the best out of the pc that they are using everyday and in every walks of life.

**b. Audit**

1.     Business and Marketing Plans

Unlock the full potential of the pc. Most hardware are softlocked to perform an action only with limited hardware, this will let the processes run faster using full hardware available to the user.

2.     Branding Strategy

Optimiser- the ability to change the performance status of the ideal pc to a higher performance pc.

3.     Market/Field Research 

Rainmeter, unpark cpu, Samurize, RocketDock, Emerge Desktop, AutoHotKey, Fences, Dexpot, Cairo for Windows, XWidget.

4.     Product Portfolio Plans 

This is a product that is very simple and easy to use program and it is free to download off the web, it is very handy when it comes to using old pcs that don't have the processing power to a high end pc or even for people with a tight budget and cannot buy an expensive pc.

5.     Competitors 

Steam Game Overlay, Overwolf, GKrellM, Bleachbit, Glary Utilities, Clean Master, Wise Registry Cleaner, Iobit Advanced Systemcare, Wise Disk Cleaner, Wise Care 365, Auslogics Boostspeed.

6.     Relevant Technologies 

Xbox 360, Playstation, Wii, iOS devices.

**c. Stakeholder Interviews**

1.     Product{project} Vision 

To be able to provide a free and easily accessible program to the masses to improve the user experience by boosting the pcs performance using the disabled components of the factory made pcs.

2.     Risk

Not knowing the full capabilities of the machine the user is using as the person using this software could be on a highend pc, and as we limit the performance status it might work in reverse. 

3.     Constraints 

There are many other programs out there giving the same functions but are not free as we have to pay to get that software, and the budgeting for the development of the program.

4.      Opportunities 

	 	In spite of the obstacles we have, this project has strength from. 

		a) Lightweight software.

		b) Free to use.

		c) Completely customisable. 
	
		d) It is very helpful to people who can't afford a good pc. 

		e) The coding is stable as the coding is done in processing.

5.      Users 

	The users are between 18-28.  

**d. User Interviews & observations**


1.      Users

	Aged between 18 -28.

2.      Potential Users

Multimedia students, and overclockers and people who use heavy software.

3.      Behaviors

Wants the best of the hardware they paid so much for as the parts for this pcs are not cheap so the underclocking of the components makes the user feel cheated by the pcs company.

4.      Attitudes

Gets frustrated when the quality of the performance of the hardware is not up to the mark as the components are way underclocked than their actual performance.

5.      Aptitudes

Users can use this application to set a benchmark for their device to perform and just let it run in the background while they do their work, the program will not disturb the user until the high load has been taken care of.

6.     Motivations

Users don’t have to worry about having to lose out on the performance of their device they paid for, it's free and easily accessible , easy to install and set the setting, easy to use as the UI is very simple.

7.     Environments

IMacs for example are soft locked to access hard wares but it has it internally so this app lets you utilise the full capability of the hardware. 

8.     Tools

Processing, Github, c++.

9.     Challenges

To make the program run smoothly with no delay in processing the data being fed into pur program to set an optimal benchmark to pc to achieve. The users don't know much about overclocking and it could cause their pc to burn up.

*II. Synthesis*

*3. Requirements Definition*

**a. Context Scenarios**

1-Adam is a student at Multimedia University. He uses his computer to study and to complete his various assignments. To complete his various assignments, he needs to use some high-end software that requires him to use his computer to its maximum potential. This high-end software uses up a lot of memory and requires a high performance pc in order for it to be stable. Adam boots up the application to check on the performance of his computer. He sees a few applications running in the background and closes it. Adam then adjusts some settings on the application and his computer immediately performs faster than before. Adam is then able to open up the software to do his assignments. 

2-Adam is a student studying in mmu under loan from the governmemt, he doesn't have a lot of money to invest into high performance pc that costs a lot. he still needs to run his high end softwares to pass up his assignments, with the program adam can use any underclocked pc which costs half the price and can unlock the full potential to use the high end softwares.

3-Adam is working for his 3D modelling class , his assignment is to design a whole room, rendering this takes days to complete on a underclocked pc , but the submission is tomorrow . adam opens out the program and runs a few settings and voila all unwanted procresses are shut down and the computer's full postential is used to procress the rendering giving him enough time to change in case of a mistake.

4-The day goes by quickly and adam is late to his submission, he needs to travel 3 hours to class ,he can just disconnect the power source of his laptop and carry it to class while the program is rendering but as the full potential of the pc is being used , the battery is also being optimised for a stable power consumption letting you run your laptop for longer while running a high load.

**b. Requirements**

**iii.	Must have**

a.	Groupings and hierarchy
https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20385650/18896660/0611f2b4-8556-11e6-8bcf-7b7cce22ca25.png

b.	Territories of each functional & design elements

The design element is to keep it simple and only used small space. The theme color is blue, green, pink.

c.	Arrangements of containers & components



*2.	Key path Scenario*

The user downloads the freeware on their pc. Once they install it, they will have to restart it because the original config files have to be overwritten. Once rebooted, they will have few new UI’s on their desktop. By using these interfaces, the user can set the range of performance they want to achieve. Once the optimal settings are set, the software will unlock the device's full potential and give the user the desired performance range.
